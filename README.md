# Astro Website

## Greetings from the Astro Club!

This repository hosts the code for the website, which can be accessed by clicking [here](https://google.com)

## Build Tools -

The site has been built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [ReactJS](https://react.dev/), with [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/) used for routing.

Additionally, React Helmet, Floating-UI and Bootstrap-CSS have been used to polish the user experience and build certain components.

#### To build -

- Make sure you have NodeJS and npm, alongside git
- Clone the repo with

```
git clone https://github.com/DorkCubed/astro_website.git
```

- `cd` into the cloned directory
- Install the dependancies and check for errors with

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Your very own version of the website should now be accessible at `http://localhost:5173/`!

- Build the website with

```
npm run build
```

- You now have the build ready at `./dist`
