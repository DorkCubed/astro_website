              The Fermi paradox aims to answer the above question, which is to figure out possible explanations as to why humanity has yet to make contact with an extraterrestrial species, even though it seems probable that there are civilizations advanced enough to communicate with us. Firstly, for simplicity’s sake, let's consider the number of such civilizations present in our own galaxy.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              The first meeting on the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) speculated that there are at least 1000 such civilizations with higher estimates in the hundreds of millions. 
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Before we get to the possible solutions to the Fermi paradox, perhaps it would be beneficial to have a brief overview of the Kardashev scale, a metric used to gauge the technological advancement of a civilization;
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Type I Civilizations are classified as those that can harness and control 100% of all energy available from their planet, they should also be able to control natural events such as tides, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Type II Civilizations are those which can utilize 100% of the energy supplied by their host star. In theory, this can be done by building a megastructure that encompasses the star, a.k.a Dyson Sphere.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Type III Civilizations can have complete control over 100% of the energy produced by their home galaxy, including all the energy produced by all objects in it.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Now that we understand how the Kardashev scale classifies civilizations(there are higher tiers as well, although for the purposes of this blog, a simple understanding of the first 3 is sufficient), we can continue exploring the various solutions of the Fermi paradox.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              An important concept that comes up regularly in solutions is The Great Filter, it can be thought of as a single or series of evolutionary roadblocks, that many civilizations crash into, there are several candidates as probable great filters:
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              <ul className="greatfilters">
                <li>The transition from primordial soup to living organisms</li>
                <li>Achieving photosynthesis</li>
                <li>Transition from Prokaryotic to Eukaryotic cells</li>
                <li>Multicellularity</li>
                <li>Evolving tool-using intelligence</li>
                <li>Gaining consciousness</li>
              </ul>
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              There are two main groups of solutions to the Fermi paradox, the first which assumes no tier II/III civilizations exist, and the second being the opposite.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              GROUP 1
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              1A. We have crossed the great filter(s)
              This solution essentially states that it is extremely rare for life to begin/be sustained on any planet, and only a handful of civilizations in the Milky Way have even begun/not wiped out in the infancy stage. Some even believe that we are the only civilization present in the galaxy.(many great minds have considered this as improbable)
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              1B. We are yet to reach the great filter(we are doomed)
              According to this solution, we are yet to reach a large cataclysmic event that can wipe out our entire species. Good candidates for such an event will be: gamma-ray bursts, large asteroids, and maybe even developing a piece of technology that wipes us all out. (laughs in Openai)
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              GROUP 2
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Solutions in this group seem to be more probable since they don't assume humanity to be special, especially when we see no evidence of us being so. A good analogy is how people used to think that the solar system and the stars were all revolving around the Earth until we proved that we were in fact not the center of attention T_T.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              2A. They have already visited Earth
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Humans have only been vibing on Earth for the last 50,000 years, and recorded human history dates back only 5500 years, barely a blink of an eye when compared to the Earth being 4.5 billion years old. So there's a decent chance, to say the least, that they arrived before humans either existed or became smart enough to communicate with each other, leading to no record of their arrival.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              2B. The Milky Way has been colonized already (who let the British have a space program)
              There’s also a chance that the entirety/a chunk(maybe a spiral arm or two) of the Milky Way has been colonized, and we just happen to live in a desolate rural corner of the galaxy nobody bothers visiting. (kinda like the library during fest season)
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              2C. Higher Species consider colonization a largely backward concept
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Since type II and III civilizations are most definitely smarter than us by several orders of magnitudes, it is likely that they do not care about colonization, and perhaps have other more pressing matters to spend time and resources on.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              2D. The Predator Solution (no, aliens aren't in the epstein files)
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              One of the reasons as to why we do not receive any signals from other civilizations is that there exist hostile predator civilizations that act as the great filter, and most intelligent life knows better than to advertise their presence to everyone. Several bright minds such as Stephen Hawking agree that it is in humanity’s best interest to stay silent.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              2E. The Superpredator Solution (no, aliens aren't discord mods)
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              Instead of predator civilizations, there exists a civilization leagues ahead in terms of advancement and keeps the galaxy that way by ensuring no civilization makes it past a certain evolutionary stage. 
              <br></br>

              2F. The Zoo Hypothesis
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              According to the zoo hypothesis, we are being kept in a state of “see but don't touch” by higher civilizations, to observe and see the progress of humanity.
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              2G. Humanity isn’t looking for the right signs (skill issue)
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              It is very possible that we are simply looking at the wrong parameters, and higher civilizations communicate using other channels, which our technology isn't advanced enough to perceive.
